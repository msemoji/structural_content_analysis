# structural_content_analysis
This Python 3 and Jupyter codebase enables the description and representation of text, such as a tweet, as its document structure and content structure. The document structure is the order of specific content types and the number of sequential elements per content type.
  
<p>Using the document structure, content structure, and content spans that are generated from this code, structural content analysis can be done to identify common structures and compare across users and groups of documents eventhough the text within a document varies.

<p> For example a sample tweet could be: RT @someuser @anotheruser This is a cool idea @user1 to analyze a ðŸ“„ with a ðŸ’»ðŸ˜€! http:someurl.com
<p> The following document structure will be generated from this code:<br>
  [('RT',1),('at_mention',2),('text',5),('at_mention',1),('text',3),('emoji',1),('text',2),('emoji',2),('punctuation',1),('url',1)]
<p> And the content structure:<br>
  ['RT','at_mention','text','at_mention','text','emoji','text','emoji','punctuation','url']
 
<p>In addition you can get the spans of content for a specific content type, e.g.:<br>
  For at_mentions: [(@someuser,@anotheruser),(@user1,)]<br>
  and for emojis: [(ðŸ“„,),(ðŸ’»,ðŸ˜€)]
